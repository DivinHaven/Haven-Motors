    "### Setup\n",
    "Configuring user information used across all local repositories.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history: `git config --global user.name \"[firstname lastname]\"`\n",
    "\n",

    "### Stage and snapshot\n",
    "Working with snapshots and the Git staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit: `git status`\n",

    "* Commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot: `git commit -m \"[descriptive message]\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch and merge\n",
    "Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes. The main branch is usually called `main` or `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new branch at the current commit: `git branch [branch-name]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory: `git checkout`\n",

    "### Ignoring patterns\n",
    "Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files. Save a file with desired patterns as `.gitignore` with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.\n",

    "5. Apply some changes to the file, check the diff and commit\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add a `main.py` file and commit\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create a branch `develop-main` and make some change to `main.py`. Commit\n",

    "   \n",
    "   Note that when you accept only the current changes, there is no new commit and you get an error when you want to sync. In this case, you have to make an empty commit or type `git merge --continue` in the command line.\n",

The maintainers can either reject it or accept and merge it to their project. Let's practice with a demo Github project.\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "  5. Add a description and then *Create a pull request* and wait for the main devs decision \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Note about Git pull, syncing and rebase** (see e.g. [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull))\n",
    "  * `git remote` is used to specify what remote endpoints the syncing commands will operate on. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `git push` is used to *upload* content to a remote repository. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `git fetch` allows to download the remote content without altering the state of the local repository (it's a safe way of syncing). `git merge` is then used to integrate the remote main into the local one. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `git pull` allows to download the remote content and immediately attempt to change the local state to match that content. It performs a `git fetch` immedialtly followed by a `git merge`. This is the unsafe way since it may unintentionally cause the local repository to get in a conflicted state.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * To avoid unncessary merge commits and ensure a linear history, the `--rebase` option can be used with `git pull` (`git rebase` is used instead of `git merge`). Many developers prefer rebasing over merging, since it’s like saying, \"I want to put my changes on top of what everybody else has done.\" There is a dedicated configuration option for it: `git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always`\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal is to make a simple python project called `Optiq` and make a nice and clear documentation using Sphinx. The project version will be controlled via Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creating the Python project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a conda env `sphx`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Create the project directory `optiq`\n",
    "3. Add a `README.md` file with short description\n",
    "4. Add the logo `optiq-logo.png`\n",
    "5. Add and populate the python script `optiq.py`\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2. Building the Sphinx project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install sphinx: `pip install sphinx`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Run `sphinx-quickstart docs` command line, separate build and source\n",
    "3. Comment the `index.rst` and `conf.py` files\n",
    "4. Split terminal and run `make html` in the `docs` directory and open the html page\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Writing in Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Markdown is simple and popular markup language with limited functionnalities\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. reStructuredText is an advanced markup language but with quite harsh syntax (see e.g. [Roles and Directives](https://documatt.com/restructuredtext-reference/intro/directives-roles.html))\n",
    "3. [MyST](https://mystmd.org/) offers the simple Markdown syntax with all the advanced features of rST\n",
    "4. Let's convert our documentation to MyST!\n",
    "   1. `pip install rst-to-myst[sphinx]`\n",
    "   2. `rst2myst convert docs/**/*.rst` in the root directory\n",
    "   3. Compare `index.rst` and `index.md`\n",
    "   4. Remove `index.rst` and run `make html` (it fails!)\n",
    "   5. Add `myst_parser` extension to `conf.py` and install it `pip install myst-parser` (Warning! Dependency errors!)\n",
    "5. To build html automatcally, install `pip install sphinx-autobuild` and run `sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html/` in the splitted terminal\n",
    "6. Try it by removing Indices and tables section from `index.md`\n",
    "7. Include the `README.md` in the `index.md` with the directive:\n",
    "````    \n",
    "```{include} ../../README.md\n",
    ":relative-images:\n",
    "```\n",
    "```` \n",
    "   \n",
    "8. Clean `index.md` and add a warning\n",
    "````   \n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "This project is under developement\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Customizing Sphinx\n",
    "Let's change the theme! \n",
    "1. Install the theme: `pip install furo`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In `conf.py`, `html_theme = \"furo\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Adding cross-references\n",
    "1. Create a new document `usage.md`. Check the output, this file doesn't belong to ant toctree, i.e. the user can not reach the document!\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Add it to index toctree\n",
    "3. Add cross-reference using the `doc` role (it links to the specified document)\n",
    "````\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check out {doc}`usage`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a hyperlink to a specific subsection. You have to add the extension `sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel`\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check out {ref}`Installation`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- This is not working properly, I think I have to install the package pip install -e .[doc], something like that\n",
    "### 6. Integrating Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create `notebooks/tutorial.ipynb` in the source directory (do not forget to install `conda install jupyter` in your environnement)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Install `pip install nbsphinx`\n",
    "3. Enable `nbsphinx` in Sphinx extensions\n",
    "4. Add `notebooks/tutorial` to toctree\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Documenting code automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add content to `usage.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can add directives specific to codes but it's not supported by MyST, you can use the following synthax:\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{eval-rst}\n",
    ".. function:: optiq.get_random_optics(kind=None)\n",
    "    Return a list of random optical elements as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    :param kind: Optional \"kind\" of optical elements.\n",
    "    :type kind: list[str] or None\n",
    "    :raise optiq.InvalidKindError: If the kind is invalid.\n",
    "    :return: The optical elements list.\n",
    "    :rtype: list[str]\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To do it automatically, enable `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. Sphinx supports a set of [autodoc directives](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to document your code. You can replace the previous lines by:\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{eval-rst}\n",
    ".. autofunction:: optiq.get_random_optics\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "Check that, editing the docstring, the documentation gets updated!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add an hyperlink to the function using the following role:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{py:func}`optiq.get_random_ingredients`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can do the same with the execption:\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{eval-rst}\n",
    ".. autoexception:: optiq.InvalidKindError\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "Notice that a cross-reference is generated from the docstring!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add an inline cross-reference using `{py:exc}` role.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Note that you can autodoc a python module using the `automodule` directive. The `sphinx-apidoc` CLI (combined with the `sphinx.ext.autosummary`) allows to auto-generate an entire python module from the docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Numpy style docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we used the default rST docstring style, let's document a new function using the Numpy style\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the `get_focal_lens` function in `optiq.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For autocompletion, install the `autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator` VSCode add-on \n",
    "3. You have to enable the `sphinx.ext.napoleon` extension to get nice styling (try with and without the extension)\n",
